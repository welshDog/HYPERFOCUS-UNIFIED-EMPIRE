Hyperfocus Mode RSI strategy option 2


1. Fine-Tune RSI Thresholds:
Adjust RSI Levels: Instead of the traditional 30 (buy) and 70 (sell), you might experiment with different levels like 20 and 80, which could reduce false signals and improve accuracy in more volatile markets.

2. Additional Technical Indicators:
Combine with Moving Averages (MA): Use Moving Average (MA) crossovers along with RSI. For instance, combine a 50-day MA and a 200-day MA with your RSI signals to confirm trends.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Use MACD signals in conjunction with RSI to confirm the strength and duration of trends.

3. Volume Analysis:
Volume Confirmation: Check for an increase in trading volume when RSI generates a signal. A surge in volume often confirms the momentum behind the RSI signal.

4. Candlestick Patterns:
Look for Reversal Patterns: Combine RSI signals with candlestick patterns such as Doji, Hammer, or Engulfing patterns to confirm reversals and entry/exit points.

5. Time Frames:
Multi-Time Frame Analysis: Monitor RSI values across different time frames (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, daily) to get a broader perspective and confirm signals.

Here's an example of how you can combine these strategies:

Example Strategy:
RSI Levels: Use RSI 20 (buy) and RSI 80 (sell).

Moving Averages: Add a 50-day and 200-day MA crossover.

Volume Confirmation: Ensure trading volume increases with RSI signals.

Candlestick Patterns: Confirm signals with reversal candlestick patterns.
