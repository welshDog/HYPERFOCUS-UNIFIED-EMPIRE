1. Run `python ip_whitelist_helper.py` to update your IP address
2. Add your current IP to your MEXC API key's whitelist
3. Restart the bot after updating the IP whitelist

### Command Not Found
If you see "command not found" errors:
1. Make sure you're in the correct directory
2. Ensure you have Python installed correctly
3. Install any missing dependencies with pip

### API Connection Issues

## Ready to Test BROski!

Your BROski Crypto Bot is now fully set up and ready for testing! Here's what you can do:

### Step 1: Test the Connection First

```bash
python cli.py
```

Choose option 1 (Check Balance) to see if your API connection works after fixing the IP whitelist issue.

### Step 2: Review Your Settings

Choose option 4 (Show Current Settings) to verify your trading configuration is correct.

### Step 3: Start the Bot in Monitoring Mode

Make sure `auto_trade` is set to `false` in your config, then choose option 3 (Start Trading Bot) to run the bot in monitoring mode. This will generate trading signals without executing actual trades.

### Important Notes:

1. **IP Whitelist** - Did you update your MEXC API whitelist with your current IP (151.224.117.246)?

2. **Logs** - Check the `logs` directory for detailed activity logs after running the bot.

3. **Start Small** - When you're ready to enable auto-trading, start with small amounts.

If you encounter any issues, refer to the detailed troubleshooting guide in the GETTING_STARTED.md file I've created.
