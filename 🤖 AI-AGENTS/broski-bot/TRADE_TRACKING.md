# BROski Trade Performance Tracking Guide

## Overview

BROski's monitor now includes powerful trade performance tracking to help you analyze your trading results and optimize your strategies. This guide explains how to use these new features and interpret the metrics displayed.

## Accessing Trade Performance Metrics

To view your trade performance metrics in the monitor window, press the `p` key at any time. This will display the Performance Panel with comprehensive statistics about your trades.

## Key Metrics Displayed

### 1. Overall Performance
- **Total Trades**: The total number of trades executed
- **Win/Loss**: Number of profitable trades vs losing trades
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of trades that resulted in profit
- **Total P&L**: Overall profit or loss from all trades (in USDT)

### 2. Trade Metrics
- **Average Win**: The average profit from winning trades
- **Average Loss**: The average loss from losing trades
- **Largest Win**: Your biggest profitable trade
- **Largest Loss**: Your biggest losing trade

### 3. Strategy Performance
- Performance breakdown by trading strategy
- Win rate for each strategy
- Total trades per strategy

### 4. Recent Trades
- List of your most recent completed trades
- Includes action (BUY/SELL), amount, price, and profit/loss

### 5. Open Positions
- Currently open trades that haven't been closed
- Shows entry price and position size

## Why These Metrics Matter

1. **Win Rate**: A successful trading strategy doesn't need to win 100% of the time. Many professional traders maintain win rates between 40-60%. What matters more is that your winning trades are larger than your losing trades.

2. **Strategy Comparison**: By tracking performance across different strategies (RSI, MACD, HyperFocus), you can determine which one works best for current market conditions.

3. **Average Win vs. Average Loss**: The ratio between these is crucial. A good trading system typically has an average win that's 1.5 to 3 times larger than the average loss.

4. **Open Positions**: Helps you monitor current exposure and potential profit/loss.

## Interpreting the Colors

- **Green**: Positive values (profitable trades, high win rates)
- **Yellow**: Neutral or moderate values
- **Red**: Negative values (losses, low win rates)

## How to Use This Information

1. **Strategy Selection**: Use the strategy-specific win rates to identify which strategy is currently most effective.

2. **Risk Management**: If your largest loss is much bigger than your average win, consider adjusting your stop-loss settings.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Look for patterns in your winning trades (time of day, market conditions) and try to replicate those conditions.

4. **Strategy Tuning**: If a particular strategy shows poor performance, consider adjusting its parameters or switching to a different strategy altogether.

## Additional Tips

- Track performance over different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Consider the overall market trend when evaluating your results
- Remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- A minimum of 30-50 trades is recommended for statistically significant results

By regularly reviewing your trade performance metrics, you can make data-driven decisions to improve your trading results over time.
