# Next Steps: Your BROski Bot is Almost Ready!

## API Key Security Check âœ“

Now that you've added your API keys to the configuration, let's make sure everything is secure:

1. **Verify Permission Settings**
   - Make sure your API key has "Read" and "Trade" permissions only
   - Confirm withdrawal permissions are **disabled**
   - Check that your API key is IP-restricted if possible

2. **Secure Your Configuration File**
   - Ensure your `config.json` is not pushed to any public repositories
   - Add `config.json` to your `.gitignore` file if using git
   - Consider using environment variables instead of hard-coding API keys

## Starting Your Bot ðŸš€

You're now ready to start using your BROski Crypto Bot! Here's how to get going:

### 1. Run the CLI Interface
```
python cli.py
```

The CLI menu will give you options to:
- Check your exchange balance
- Modify trading parameters
- Start the trading bot
- View recent trading activity

### 2. Test with Monitoring Mode First

Before enabling automatic trading, start with monitoring mode:
1. Make sure `auto_trade` is set to `false` in your configuration
2. Let the bot run for a few days to analyze its signals
3. Review the signals in your logs or Telegram notifications
4. Once you're confident in the signals, consider enabling auto trading

### 3. Check System Requirements

Ensure your system meets these requirements for optimal performance:
- Stable internet connection
- Sufficient disk space for logs (at least 500MB free)
- Ability to run continuously (or use Docker for better reliability)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues ðŸ”§

### API Connection Problems
- **Error: "Invalid API Key"** - Double-check your API key and secret are entered correctly
- **Error: "IP not allowed"** - Your current IP doesn't match the API key restrictions
- **Connection timeouts** - Check your internet connection or MEXC API status

### Trading Issues
- **Insufficient balance errors** - Ensure you have enough funds in your MEXC account
- **No signals generated** - Check your strategy configuration and market conditions
- **Orders not executing** - Verify trading permissions and account restrictions

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues with your BROski bot:
1. Check the log files in the `logs` directory
2. Review the setup guide and troubleshooting sections
3. Make sure your API keys have the correct permissions

## Next Recommended Steps

1. **Implement a test strategy** with small trade amounts
2. **Monitor the bot's performance** for at least a week
3. **Gradually adjust parameters** for better results
4. **Keep your API keys secure** and rotate them periodically
