some examples of trades using the technical indicators

### 1. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
**Example Trade:**
- **Buy Signal:** When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it indicates a potential buy opportunity. For instance, if the MACD line crosses above the signal line at a price of $50, you might consider buying the stock.
- **Sell Signal:** When the MACD line crosses below the signal line, it indicates a potential sell opportunity. If the MACD line crosses below the signal line at a price of $55, you might consider selling the stock.

### 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
**Example Trade:**
- **Buy Signal:** When the RSI falls below 30, it indicates that the stock is oversold and may be due for a rebound. For example, if the RSI drops to 25 and the stock price is $100, you might consider buying.
- **Sell Signal:** When the RSI rises above 70, it indicates that the stock is overbought and may be due for a pullback. If the RSI rises to 75 and the stock price is $110, you might consider selling.

### 3. Bollinger Bands
**Example Trade:**
- **Buy Signal:** When the stock price touches the lower Bollinger Band, it indicates that the stock may be oversold. For instance, if the stock price touches the lower band at $45, you might consider buying.
- **Sell Signal:** When the stock price touches the upper Bollinger Band, it indicates that the stock may be overbought. If the stock price touches the upper band at $55, you might consider selling.

### 4. Stochastic Oscillator
**Example Trade:**
- **Buy Signal:** When the stochastic oscillator falls below 20, it indicates that the stock is oversold. For example, if the oscillator drops to 15 and the stock price is $30, you might consider buying.
- **Sell Signal:** When the stochastic oscillator rises above 80, it indicates that the stock is overbought. If the oscillator rises to 85 and the stock price is $35, you might consider selling.

### 5. Fibonacci Retracement
**Example Trade:**
- **Buy Signal:** When the stock price retraces to a key Fibonacci level (e.g., 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) and shows signs of support, it indicates a potential buy opportunity. For instance, if the stock price retraces to the 50% level at $60 and shows support, you might consider buying.
- **Sell Signal:** When the stock price retraces to a key Fibonacci level and shows signs of resistance, it indicates a potential sell opportunity. If the stock price retraces to the 61.8% level at $70 and shows resistance, you might consider selling.

### 6. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
**Example Trade:**
- **Buy Signal:** When the stock price is below the VWAP and starts to move above it, it indicates a potential buy opportunity. For example, if the stock price moves above the VWAP at $40, you might consider buying.
- **Sell Signal:** When the stock price is above the VWAP and starts to move below it, it indicates a potential sell opportunity. If the stock price moves below the VWAP at $45, you might consider selling.
