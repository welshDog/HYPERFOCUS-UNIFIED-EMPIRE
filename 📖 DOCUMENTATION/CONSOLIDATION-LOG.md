## üìù Decision Criteria

### Architecture Decisions
When making consolidation decisions, we prioritize:
1. **Neurodivergent-Friendly**: Reduces cognitive load and context switching
2. **History Preservation**: Maintains learning and reference materials
3. **Unified Workflows**: Single commands for complex operations
4. **Scalable Design**: Supports future growth and complexity
5. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined component responsibilities

### Conflict Resolution
When components conflict:
1. **Prefer Latest**: Use most recent implementation as canonical
2. **Archive Legacy**: Preserve older versions for reference
3. **Document Migration**: Clear path from old to new
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure no functionality loss
5. **Gradual Transition**: Support both old and new during migration
