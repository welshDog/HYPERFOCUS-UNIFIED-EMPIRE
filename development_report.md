# BROski Crypto Bot - Development Report

## Project Overview
BROski is an automated cryptocurrency trading bot designed to interact with exchanges (primarily MEXC), execute trades based on signals, and provide alerts through Telegram. The bot aims to be user-friendly with a simple configuration system and CLI interface.

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Core Architecture ‚úÖ
- [x] Created main bot structure
- [x] Designed modular component system
- [ ] Code review and optimization

**Status:** We've established the initial architecture with a modular design that separates concerns between data fetching, signal generation, trade execution, and notifications.

---

### 2. Configuration System ‚úÖ
- [x] Created `config.json` structure
- [x] Implemented config loading functionality
- [ ] Add validation for user inputs

**Status:** The configuration system allows users to store their API keys, trading preferences, and notification settings without editing code. Next, we need to add validation to prevent configuration errors.

---

### 3. Exchange API Connector ‚è≥
- [x] Implemented price fetching via MEXC API
- [ ] Complete order placement functionality
- [ ] Add balance checking
- [ ] Implement error handling for API failures

**Status:** Basic price fetching is working through the MEXC API. We still need to complete order execution logic and add robust error handling for API timeouts and failures.

---

### 4. Trading Strategy Engine ‚è≥
- [x] Created basic signal generation framework
- [ ] Implement RSI strategy
- [ ] Implement MACD strategy
- [ ] Add AI-based signal generation option
- [ ] Build backtesting capabilities

**Status:** We have a framework for signal generation but need to implement specific strategies. The AI-based signal generation will be implemented as an optional feature that can be enabled in the config.

---

### 5. User Interface ‚úÖ
- [x] Developed CLI menu system
- [x] Added balance checking command
- [x] Implemented trade amount configuration
- [ ] Add strategy selection options

**Status:** The CLI provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the bot. Users can check balances, configure trading parameters, and start the bot through a simple menu system.

---

### 6. Notification System ‚è≥
- [x] Created basic Telegram integration
- [ ] Implement trade notification formatting
- [ ] Add error notifications
- [ ] Support for multiple notification channels

**Status:** We have basic Telegram integration but need to improve the formatting of notifications and add support for critical error alerts.

---

### 7. Deployment Options ‚è≥
- [x] Created Dockerfile for containerization
- [ ] Test Docker deployment
- [ ] Add Docker Compose for easier management
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

**Status:** We've created a Dockerfile to containerize the application, making it easy to deploy on various platforms including VPS and Raspberry Pi.

---

### 8. Documentation üìù
- [x] Initial setup instructions
- [ ] User manual
- [ ] Strategy documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

**Status:** Basic setup instructions are available, but we need to create comprehensive documentation for users.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Trading Logic**
   - Finish order placement and management
   - Implement risk management rules
   - Add support for stop-loss and take-profit orders

2. **Enhance Strategy Engine**
   - Complete implementation of technical indicators
   - Add strategy parameter optimization
   - Implement the AI prediction module

3. **Improve Testing**
   - Add unit tests for critical components
   - Create integration tests for API interactions
   - Develop a backtesting framework for strategy evaluation

4. **User Experience**
   - Create detailed logs for troubleshooting
   - Add performance metrics and reporting
   - Develop a web dashboard (long-term goal)

### Data Flow
1. Configuration is loaded at startup
2. Price data is fetched from the exchange
3. Strategy engine analyzes data and generates signals
4. Trade execution module places orders based on signals
5. Notification system alerts users of actions taken
6. CLI provides user control and information

## Deployment Status
- Local development: Functional
- Docker container: Created but needs testing
- VPS deployment: Not yet implemented

## Known Issues
1. Need better error handling for API connection failures
2. Configuration validation is incomplete
3. Testing coverage is minimal
